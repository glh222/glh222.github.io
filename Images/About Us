Operating from a state-of-the-art facility that's located in the heart of Long Island, our expertly trained staff is committed to serving each of your needs from the moment you walk through our doors, keeping one tenet in mind above all else: treating you like a member of our "family" from the moment you walk through the doors of our new Maserati showroom and service center.</p>

<p>Another reason why Maserati of Long Island stands apart is due to our heavy community involvement. More than just a gesture of good will, this aspect of our operation is one of the backbones of our business. For instance, whenever a vehicle is purchased from our dealership, our team makes a donation to our area's local hospital. This small gesture represent not only our gratitude to you, our customer, but also our commitment to bettering our community.</p>

<p>Our new Maserati dealership is truly proud to represent one of the finest automotive marquees on the road today, delivering an exceptional range of Quattroporte, Granturismo and Ghibli models from which to choose. Beyond our array of Maserati models we offer, our dealership is truly known for creating one of the most unique purchasing experiences in the industry today: one that centers around treating our clients like family and contributing to a larger good at the same time.</p>
